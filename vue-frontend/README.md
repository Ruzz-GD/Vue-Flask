### To communicate with Flask server-side, we'll need to use an API. Two popular tools for this purpose are Axios and Fetch. Axios is a widely-used HTTP client library for making AJAX requests in JavaScript. It simplifies the process of sending asynchronous HTTP requests to the server and handling responses.

npm install axios
```
